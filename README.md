# Chaining Augmentation

## Project Overview

**Chaining Augmentation** is a Go-based application designed to demonstrate how function chaining can be implemented efficiently. It showcases how individual functions can be combined in a modular way to achieve complex transformations. This repository includes:

- `README.md`: Documentation for understanding the project.
- `go.mod` and `go.sum`: The Go modules and dependency files required to run the project.
- `main.go`: The core application demonstrating function chaining in Go.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mesutoezdil/prompt_engineering_02.git
   cd chaining-augmentation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   The project uses Go modules, so ensure you have Go installed and run:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   Use the following command to execute the program:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## main.go Structure

The `main.go` file is the core of this project. Below is an overview of its content and functionality:

### Key Functions:

- **Function Chaining Implementation**:
  This example demonstrates a method for chaining functions, enabling the transformation of data through multiple steps. Each function returns a function of the same type, allowing chaining.

- **Modular Design**:
  The code is written in a modular style, separating concerns and making each function reusable across different contexts.

### Example Usage:

The following example shows how a series of transformations can be chained together using the functions defined in `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Sample function that performs a transformation
func add(x int) int {
	return x + 1
}

// Another function that multiplies a value
func multiply(x int) int {
	return x * 2
}

// Chaining function that applies multiple transformations
func chainOperations(x int) int {
	x = add(x)
	x = multiply(x)
	return x
}

func main() {
	value := 5
	result := chainOperations(value)
	fmt.Println("Result after chaining operations:", result)
}
```

### Output:

When you run the program, it performs the chained operations on the input `value` and outputs the result:

```bash
Result after chaining operations: 12
```

### Summary of Changes Made to `main.go`

- Implemented a simple chain of operations (`add` and `multiply`).
- The `chainOperations` function combines these two transformations to demonstrate how multiple functions can be chained together.
- Used the `fmt` package to print the results for easy testing and output visualization.

## Future Improvements

- **Extend Functionality**: New functions can be added to the chain for more complex transformations
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling within each function to make the application more robust
- **CLI Interface**: Add a command-line interface (CLI) for dynamic user input and testing of different values
